# :tent: AI Experiment Land
This is a playground for me to try different AI tools and build AI projects. If you want to try the projects I built, you can click the project file and run it on Google Colab.

### 1. [Trun Image into Audio Story](./ImageToAudioStory/Readme.md)
> This is an AI tool that can take an input image and generate an audio story about that image. I used Hugging Face to get models I need and displayed my project using Streamlit UI.
